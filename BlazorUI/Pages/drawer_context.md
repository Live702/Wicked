# Drawer Context Log

## 2024-05-10T15:19 (First Entry)

### Requirements
- Remove the drawer header.
- The text box must fill the drawer with exactly 3px of padding on all sides, including the bottom edge.
- Prevent the content inside the drawer from scrolling.

### Goals
- Achieve a clean, modern UI where the text box is the only content in the drawer and is visually balanced with consistent padding.
- Ensure the text box does not overflow or disappear off the screen.

### Last Attempt (Flexbox Solution)
- Used flexbox on both `MudDrawerContent` and `MudContainer` with `height: 100%` and `display: flex; flex-direction: column;`.
- Set the container to `padding: 3px; box-sizing: border-box;`.
- Set the text field to `flex: 1 1 0; min-height: 0; width: 100%; resize: none;`.

#### Outcome
- The text box now fills the available space in the drawer and respects the 3px padding on all sides, including the bottom edge.
- Awaiting user confirmation if this fully resolves the issue or if further adjustments are needed.

## 2024-05-10T15:28 (Scroll Clipping Issue)

### Observed Behavior
- When the text box contains multiple lines, the user can scroll within the text box, but cannot scroll all the way to the top; the first few lines are hidden.

### Analysis
- Suspected that `flex: 1 1 0` on the text box, combined with the container's padding, may be causing the text box to overflow its container by a few pixels, hiding the top.
- Decided to try changing the text box style from `flex: 1 1 0` to `flex: 1 1 auto` to see if this resolves the scroll clipping issue.

### Change
- Updated the MudTextField style to: `flex: 1 1 auto; min-height: 0; width: 100%; resize: none;`.

#### Outcome
- Awaiting user feedback to see if this resolves the issue where the top of the text box is clipped and cannot be scrolled into view.
